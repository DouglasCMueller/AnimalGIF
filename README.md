Animal GIF API
Developer: Douglas C. Mueller
This is an exercise using the Giphy API to create clickable buttons showing GIF's related to an animal button value.  Users can also add new animals using an input box. It is written in javascript with a jquery library. 
Issues:
1. I attempted the "bonus" involving saving favorite buttons with local storage that would reappear on user coming back to webpage.  First, I attempted using "git stash" and found that I had created multiple "head branches" locally and gave up trying to figure out "git stash".  I will work on reading up more on "git stash".  Second, I simply recreated the original finished exercise and gave it a new repo.  I then worked on getting the user added buttons - store them in a "favorites section" and have them load on user opening webpage.  I did get the original buttons to store and reappear, but had difficulty getting new added buttons to store.  I gave up on the "bonus", but I will review the exercises on local storage in the near future.  I did not submit the new local storage repo, as it wasn't working correctly.
